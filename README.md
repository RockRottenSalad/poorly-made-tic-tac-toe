# poorly-made-tic-tac-toe
new dev who just discovered raylib tried re-creating tic tac toe<br>
download tictactoe.out alongside tictactoe.png and arial.ttf to make it run, might or might not require raylib<br>
keep everything in the same directory or it probably wont run<br>
runs fine on linux, will give you a seizure on windows(in other words: doesn't function on windows)
