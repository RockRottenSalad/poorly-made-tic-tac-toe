# poorly-made-tic-tac-toe
rookie amateur programmer who just discovered raylib tried re-creating tic tac toe<br>

runs on linux and probably depends on raylib<br>
will give you a seizure on windows(in other words: doesn't function on windows)<br><br>

to make it run:<br>
1: download tictactoe.out alongside tictactoe.png and arial.ttf <br>
2: keep everything in the same directory or it probably wont run<br>
3: run tictactoe.out by using the command: `./tictactoe.out`<br><br>

if you'd like to compile it yourself:<br>
1: download raylib libary from https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux<br>
2: install the gcc compiler<br>
3: download source.c, arial.ttf and tictactoe.png<br>
4: compile the code by running:<br>
`gcc source.c -lraylib`
